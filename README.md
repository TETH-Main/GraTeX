# Graph + LaTeX = GraTeX
GraTeX allows you to turn the equations you enter into the Desmos Graphing Caluculator into graphs and LaTeX math equations images that you can save for use in other documents.

GraTeX generates Graph and LaTeX together in an image.

## Live Demo
The application is accessible at [https://teth-main.github.io/GraTeX/](https://teth-main.github.io/GraTeX/)

## Usage
1.　Put LaTeX equation in Desmos Graphing Caluculator
2.　Click generate
3.　Save Image

### option
If you remove the grid and axes from the settings in the upper right corner of Desmos Graphing Caluculator, you will get a graph-only image.
You can change the size of the text from LabelSize.
It is recommended to set the text size to 1 for long expressions.

## Notes
The equation in the output image is taken from the top LaTeX equation in the Desmos Graphing Calculator; even if an error occurs in the Desmos Graphing Calculator, the LaTeX equation is taken and output.
